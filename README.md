# Fast-Food_SQL Database
“A case study involving databases, SQL coding, primary and foreign keys, related tables, and insights.”

A few months ago, I embarked on an exciting project: serving as the Data Analyst for the up-and-coming brand "Fast Food" in the fast-food sector. Despite their initial success in opening new branches, the company still grappled with managing scattered information across Google Sheets files and manual documents. My task was essential: to build a consolidated database that would ensure scalability and efficiency in decision-making.

I began by collecting existing files and employed the Data Manipulation Language (DML) to formulate complex SQL queries. I optimized the database for analysis using external tools and utilized the Data Definition Language (DDL) to guarantee its future viability. In my day-to-day work, I faced practical challenges—from the initial design to troubleshooting with advanced SQL.

Throughout the project, I answered basic business questions such as "How many Employees per department?" and "How many products exist per category?" using simple queries with aggregation functions. As I progressed, I tackled more complex queries like "What is the average price of products within each category?" and "How many products of each type have been sold in each branch?" These advanced queries allowed me to explore patterns through JOINs.

Beyond technical skills in SQL, I honed my ability to address complex situations, make informed decisions, and present findings clearly. At the project's conclusion, I provided valuable insights to the senior management of "Fast Food," guiding data-driven strategic decisions.
